- 👋 My name is Lucas Cassiano Maciel dos Santos, and i'm 17;
- 🇧🇷 I'm Brazilian, and currently live in Maceió, Alagoas;
- 📚 I'm currently in high school, attending Instituto Federal de Alagoas (IFAL), taking a technical computer course;
- 🕹️ I usually program in Python and JavaScript;
- 🌎 I speak English, German and Portuguese (native language);


Since I started programming three years ago, in 2019, my interest has grown more and more, so I created this account on Github to record and encourage my progress, as well as creating a portfolio. 💻
